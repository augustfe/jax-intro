# An Introduction to JAX

This book is an introduction to [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a library for numerical computing in Python that is designed for high-performance machine learning research. JAX is a powerful tool for writing numerical code that is fast, scalable, and easy to debug. It is built on top of the XLA compiler, which allows it to run on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. JAX also provides a functional programming model that makes it easy to write code that is parallelizable and composable.
